# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. 

## Features

- **2-Player Mode**: Two players alternate turns to place their respective markers ('X' and 'O') on the game board.
- **Custom Images**: The **X** and **O** symbols are displayed as custom images, providing a more visually appealing experience.
- **Game Restart**: After a win or a draw, the game automatically resets after a short delay, allowing players to start a new game.
- **Game Status Display**: The game continuously displays the current player's turn or the winner on the screen. If the game ends in a draw, that status is displayed as well.
